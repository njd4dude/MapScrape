If you want to use this code you must have your own .env file with the api key. This has tailwind css implemented into it.

Note: buildjsx and servejsx is just to view live html and makes editing easier without having to refresh the extension everytime. The difference between the two is that webpack serve does not create a seperate folder, instead files are served directly from memory.
